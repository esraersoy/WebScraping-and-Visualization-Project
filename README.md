# WEB SCRAPING AND VISUALIZATION PROJECT
The news articles from PR NewsWire website are parsed and stock prices are visualized based on the content from the parsed articles
The project guidelines are followed in the order of instructions as listed below:
 - Scan (the last two weeks or the last week, upto you) and parse news from “newswire” website : i.	https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/news-releases-list/ 
 - Keep track of the news by storing the parsed news somewhere (CSV, DF, DB, EXCEL, anything else) 
 - For all parsed news, search the content of the tracked news to find at least 2-3 stock symbols in a specific industry of your choice; e.g: (TSX: TSLA); (TSX: GM)
 - Scan Yahoo! Finance page for the stock symbols that appeared in the news (there should be a module for yahoo finance that you can use instead of looking for webpage content).
 - Capture/retrieve the stock price and volume for last 30 days.
 - Prepare colourful visualization/graphs showing stock prices for last 30 days.
 - Visualization should be a plot (time - series) for: Volume   Daily Close Price
